            <p><strong>Pastor & Community Worker</strong></p>
            <p>Welcome. This platform is an extension of my ministry and my heart for the people. While I serve as a Pastor under the PICC family, <em>In His Presence Prayer Altar</em> is a personal initiative dedicated to intercession and community building.</p>
            
            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>I believe that the pulpit is not just inside the church walls, but out in the streets. As a community worker by profession, I bridge the gap between spiritual needs and social realities.</p>
