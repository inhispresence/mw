            <p><strong>Pastor & Community Worker</strong></p>
            <p>Welcome. <em>In His Presence Prayer Altar</em> is a personal initiative through which I seek to connect, pray, and support individuals outside the formal church setting. While I serve as a pastor with the PICC family, this platform allows me to engage with people as a pastor in a more personal capacity.</p>
            
            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>I believe that ministry extends beyond church walls. As a community worker by profession, I aim to address both spiritual and social needs, offering guidance, prayer, and practical support wherever it is needed.</p>
